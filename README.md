# Bank_Campaign_Marketing

This is a group project for the Virtual Internship
## Overview
Digital marketing campaigns are ubiquitous as organizations compete for their client's attention. In this project I explore the challenge of creating an effective marketing strategy in the context of banks. The data set is taken from UCI's Machine Learning Repository. Using the data from the previously carried out marketing campaign and client information I build models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not in a future marketing campaign. Ultimately, the goal is to enable the marketing team to optimize their resources to reach out to those clients who have the highest likelihood to need and subscribe to the term deposit.

## Objective
The goal is to build Machine Learning model that helps in 
predicting the outcomes of each customer's marketing campaign and analyzing which features have an impact on the outcomes that will help the company to understand how to make the campaign more effective. Additionally, categorizing the customer group that subscribed to the term deposit helps to determine who is more likely to purchase the product in the future,thereby developing more targeted marketing campaigns. 
This can be accomplished by using a ML model that shortlists the customers whose possibility of purchasing the product is higher.So that marketing such as telemarketing,SMS or email marketing can concentrate only on those customers.It will save time and resources by doing this.
